However, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. Here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in Escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion partner. The fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. The fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni 2+ -NTA) resin chromatography. After the SUMO-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the SUMO protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a Ni 2+ -NTA column. Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. The recombinantly expressed Scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R. It also produced 100% reduction in Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro. Thus, the expression strategy presented in this study allowed convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant Scorpine for pharmaceutical applications in the future.

PLoS ONE 9(7): e103456.\",\"The oldest known scorpions lived around 430 million years ago in the Silurian period, on the bottom of shallow tropical seas, hence regarded as the oldest terrestrial arthropods [1] . Scorpions use venoms for immobilization of prey and protection against predators. Scorpion venoms consist of a complex of several toxins that exhibit a wide range of biological properties and actions, as well as chemical compositions, toxicity, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic characteristics [2] .\n","Scorpions are a rich source of antimicrobial peptides: (1) androctonin isolated from the hemolymph of Androctonus australis, shows marked sequence similarity to tachyplesins, polyphemusins and gomesin [3, 4] ; (2) hadrurin from the venom of Hadrurus aztecus, which is hemolytic [5] ; (3) opistoporin-1, which possesses hemolytic activity, and opistoporin-2, both from the venom of the South African scorpion Opistophtalmus carinatus [6] ; (4) scorpine, which is the subject of this study, arising from the venom of Pandinus imperator, was shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activity in vitro [7] , and has shown a potent toxic effect on sexual and asexual stages of Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum, respectively, and also a strong inhibition of dengue 2 virus (DENV-2) infection [8] . Native scorpine purified from venom glands has a molecular mass of 8, 350 Da. It has a peculiar structure compared to other known AMPs. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence is similar to cecropins, whereas its C-terminal region has several disulfide bridges, similar to the structure of defensins [7] . Scorpine's wide range of activities provides the possibility that scorpine can be used as an antimicrobial and anti-plasmodial agent in the future.\n","For pharmaceutical applications, a large quantity of antimicrobial peptides need to be produced economically. Isolation of antibacterial peptides from natural sources is inefficient and timeconsuming. The biosynthesis of recombinant antimicrobial peptides in vivo is currently the most popular technique of preparing polypeptides. The Escherichia coli expression system is still the most commonly used because of its high level of expression, the relative simplicity of the DNA manipulations, and the short time required to produce product. Because of their natural destructive behavior toward microorganisms and relative sensitivity to proteolytic degradation, antimicrobial peptides are often produced by being fused to a fusion partner in heterologous hosts to neutralize their innate toxic activity and increase their expression levels [9] .\n","Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is an ubiquitin-related protein that functions by covalent attachment to other proteins. It is known that the SUMO, fused at the N-terminus with other proteins, can fold and protect the protein by its chaperoning properties, making it a useful tag for heterologous expression. These advantages include the manner in which protein expression is enhanced, proteolytic degradation of the target protein is decreased, protein folding and solubility are increased, and purification and detection are simplified [10] [11] [12] .\n","In this study, we provide the first report of the procedures for obtaining a recombinant Scorpine by using SUMO fusion partner and investigate its anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities.\n","Bacterial Strains, Vectors, and Enzymes E. coli DH5a (maintained in our laboratory) was used for subcloning and plasmid amplification. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, USA) was used as the expression host. The linearized pSUMO vector with Bsa I and Xho I restriction sites and T7 promoter and kanamycin resistance and 66His sequence was purchased from LifeSensors (LifeSensors, Malvern, PA, USA). SUMO protease containing a histidine-tag was also the product of Lifesensors (Malvern, PA, USA). All the restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Takara Biotech Co. Ltd (Dalian, China).\n","Strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 were purchased from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC, China) and cultured according to the method provided by CGMCC.\n","Strains of S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R were isolated in clinc in the Third People's Hospital of Wuxi. The bacteria sampling was obtained in the burn wounds from burn patients, and was crossed to cultivate on blood agar for 24 hours to obtain monoclonal colony, and then monoclonal bacteria were multiplication cultured in liquid medium for 24 h. The identification of proliferative monoclonal bacteria was first carried out with using VITEK R 2 -Compact automatic bacteria identification device (BIOMERIEUX) and furthermore, the isolated bacteria were confirmed through polymerase chain reaction amplification of conserved region of nuc gene for S. aureus (FW: 59-GCGATTGATGGTGATACGGTI-39, RV: 59-AGCCAAGCCTTGACGAACTAAAGC-39) [13] , and multiplex amplification of 16 S-23 S ribo-somal DNA intergenic spacer region and conserved region of the recA gene for A. baumannii (FW: 59-CATTATCACGGTAATTAGTG-39, RV: 59-AGAG-CACTGTGCACTTAAG-39 for 16 S-23 S ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer region; FW: 59-CCTGAATCTTCTGG-TAAAAC-39, RV: 59-GTTTCTGGGCTGCCAAACATTAC-39 for recA gene) [14] . All PCR products were sequenced to confirm in GenScript Corporation (Nanjing, China).\n","The antibiotic susceptibility was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) procedure [15] . The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected antibiotics were shown in Table 1 . The MICs were determined at concentrations, at which there was no visible growth. The susceptible (S), and resistant (R) strains were defined based on MIC values of ,4 mg/ml, and more than 16 mg/ml, respectively [16] .\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Bx34lZhGdTeG","colab_type":"code","outputId":"8082870d-5b7a-438c-a998-68045031d6bb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586729941650,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":239,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Gudal","photoUrl":"","userId":"08624427883208564276"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35}},"source":["df"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<_csv.reader at 0x7fb4177dbe48>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QDOBtU-AeXgU","colab_type":"code","outputId":"5651037b-b85b-4e19-ad6c-9f2e199dd59c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586730171748,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":249,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Gudal","photoUrl":"","userId":"08624427883208564276"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35}},"source":["[]*7"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"x-AkQ1ELfPwI","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
